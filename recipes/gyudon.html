                    <li>1 tablespoon (12g) sugar</li>
                    <li>1/2 pound (225g) thinly shaved beef ribeye or chuck steak</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon (5ml) grated fresh ginger</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>2 cups cooked white rice</li>
                    <li>2 large poached eggs (optional)</li>
                    <li>Sliced scallions</li>
                    <li>Beni-shoga</li>
                    <li>Togarashi</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Combine onion, dashi, sake, soy sauce, and sugar in a medium saucepan or saucier and bring to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Add beef and cook, stirring until beef is cooked through and liquid has reduced down to an intensely flavored broth, about 5 minutes. Stir in ginger and simmer for 1 minute longer. Adjust seasoning with salt and sugar to taste.</li>
                    <li>Divide rice between 2 to 3 bowls and top with beef and sauce mixture. Garnish each bowl with a poached egg (if using), sliced scallions, beni-shoga, and togarashi. Serve immediately.</li>
